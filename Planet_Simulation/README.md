# 🌌 Planet Simulation 🚀🌍

Welcome to the **Planet Simulation**, where you can experience the magic of gravity and orbits in action! 🌍🌑✨ This Python project lets you simulate the solar system with **Pygame**, and watch planets like Earth, Mars, and Venus orbit around the Sun just like in real life (well, almost!) 🌞

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 **Gravitational Attraction**: Watch planets interact with the sun and each other!
  
- 🪐 **Orbits in Action**: Planets move around the sun, and their orbits are drawn in real time.
  
- 🌟 **Realistic Motion**: Thanks to **Newton's Law of Gravitation**, planets move with actual physics (or as close as we can get!).
  
- 🌞 **Planet Customization**: You can add your own planets, change their size, and even modify their speeds!

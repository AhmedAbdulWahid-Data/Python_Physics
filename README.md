# Python Physics Projects

This repository contains three physics simulations built using Python and Pygame.

## 1. Gravitational Slingshot Effect

This project simulates the gravitational slingshot effect where a spacecraft uses a planet's gravity to gain speed.

**Key Features:**
- Simulates the gravitational interaction between a spacecraft and a planet.
- Objects (spacecraft) can be launched and move based on gravitational forces.

**Files:**
- `gravitational_sling.py`: Main file for the slingshot simulation.

## 2. Pymunk Swinging Ball Simulation

This project uses Pymunk to create a physics simulation where a ball swings from a pivot point, simulating a pendulum-like motion.

**Key Features:**
- Uses Pymunk for physics simulation.
- Ball swings around a pivot, applying forces based on mouse input.

**Files:**
- `swinging_ball.py`: Main file for the swinging ball simulation.

## 3. Planet Simulation

This project simulates planetary motion, using physics principles to model the movement of planets around a star.

**Key Features:**
- Simulates gravitational attraction between planets and the Sun.
- Visualizes planet orbits and gravitational interactions.

**Files:**
- `planet_simulation.py`: Main file for the planetary motion simulation.

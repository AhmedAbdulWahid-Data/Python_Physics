# 🌌 Python Physics Simulations 🚀

Welcome to a world of mind-blowing physics simulations, where Python meets the laws of the universe! These simulations let you play with gravity, swinging balls, and orbiting planets. Ready to explore the cosmos and beyond? Let's dive in! 🌠

## 1. **Gravitational Slingshot Effect** 🛸💨

Ever wondered how spacecraft use planets to slingshot through space? Well, wonder no more! This simulation shows how spacecraft gain speed by utilizing a planet's gravity.

### Key Features:
- Watch a spacecraft **harness the power** of a planet's gravity to slingshot across space.
- Move your spacecraft and feel the forces of **gravity** in action. 🚀

### Files:
- `gravitational_sling.py`: The **main engine** behind the gravity-powered slingshot!

## 2. **Pymunk Swinging Ball** ⚽🎢

This one's for the physics lovers! A ball swinging back and forth like a pendulum, but with real-time physics, powered by **Pymunk**. It’s as fun as it sounds!

### Key Features:
- Watch the **pendulum** swing based on forces you control!
- Interact by clicking and dragging to **feel the physics** in your fingertips. 🌀

### Files:
- `swinging_ball.py`: Swing that ball and see the magic happen!

## 3. **Planetary Motion Simulation** 🌍🌑

Time to play God of the Solar System! 🌞 Simulate the motion of planets around a star, following the laws of gravitational attraction.

### Key Features:
- **Orbiting planets**: Watch as planets circle their star with perfect gravitational dance.
- See how gravity influences the **planetary system**! 🌍💫

### Files:
- `planet_simulation.py`: Control the universe with this file!
